All the members inherited from class Object; the only method of Object that is not inherited is its clone method.
When you clone a single dimensional array, such as Object[], a “deep copy” is performed with the new array containing copies of the original array’s elements as opposed to references.
A clone of a multidimensional array (like Object[][]) is a “shallow copy” however, which is to say that it creates only a single new array with each element array a reference to an original element array but subarrays are shared.
